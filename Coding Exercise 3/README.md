# Tell me about your proudest professional achievement.  It can be a personal or school project.  

    My proudest accomplishment was completing capstone project for Lambda.  I fought so hard to get to that moment.  It was difficult technically, emotionally, and psychologically.  I wanted to postpone the project many times in the beginning but I stuck it out and learned so much. I became a better, stronger person for it.  

## Tell me a about a book, blog, article or GitHub repo you read or liked recently, and why you like it and why you should recommend I do the same. 

    Well, because I am in the process of job searching, the article that has had the greatest impact on me recently is a Medium article entitled "A React job interview — recruiter perspective."(linked below) https://medium.com/@baphemot/a-react-job-interview-recruiter-perspective-f1096f54dd16
    This article really gave me insight into how recruiters and hiring managers think, what is important to them, and it poses very thought-provoking questions.  Many of the questions in this article are asking why something works the way it does as opposed to what something is or how you perform a certain action.  It forces you to get more intimate with React and find out the “why” behind the functionality.  This article is a great reminder that figuring out why something works is just as or even more import as figuring out how it works. It opened my eyes to some gaps in knowledge that I had and made me want to learn more.  I now feel better prepared for interviews and I have grown as a developer.  Even if someone is established in their career, as I’m sure the person reading this is, this is still a good read.  It may expose some gaps in knowledge you weren’t aware of, make you reconsider what questions you ask during an interview, or at the least give you better insight into job candidates.
